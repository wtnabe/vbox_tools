== Description

 If you use windows, type like below:

 C:\Ruby\bin> copy ..\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\vbox_config_admin-X.X.X\bin\vbox_config_admin.bat .

 Remember the last period(.) !

 Note: I've tested it on MacOSX and Windows host. But Linux host hasn't been tried yet.

=== Clone

== Features/Problems

 * create backup for both whole and each machines' config xml
 * check and delete backup files
 * open real config and backup file

 Problem: On Windows host, you will not open XXXX.xml config file. But you can open backup files. I don't know why.

 vbox_config_admin 

 You can see available tasks, if you've already installed VirtualBox.
