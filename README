== Description

 create VirtualBox config xml file backup, and force shutdown virtual machines, written in Ruby and Rake

== Requirements

 * Ruby ( 1.8 or later )
 * Rake

== Installation

=== Gem Installation

   gem install vbox_tools

 If you use windows, type like below:

 C:\Ruby\bin> copy ..\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\vbox_tools-X.X.X\bin\vbox_tools.bat .

 Remember the last period(.) !

 Note: I've tested it on MacOSX and Windows host. But Linux host hasn't been tried yet.

=== Clone

   git clone git://github.com/wtnabe/vbox_tools.git 

== Features/Problems

 * create backup for both whole and each machines' config xml
 * check and delete backup files
 * open real config and backup file
 * shutdown running and saved virtual machines

 Problem: On Windows host, you will not open XXXX.xml config file. But you can open backup files. I don't know why.

== Synopsis

 Just type as:

 vbox_tools

 You can see available tasks, if you've already installed VirtualBox.
